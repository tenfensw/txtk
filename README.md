# TXTk
*TXTk* is an experimental port of TXLib to Tcl programming language using the Tk toolkit.

## What works?
- Drawing circles, lines, ovals, etc
- Drawing text
- Message boxes

## What doesn't work?
- In-memory canvases
- CLI colors
- Some other stuff

## Example
See ``improved_port.tcl``. Run it using ``wish``, not ``tclsh``.
